# QR_W_Logo
# A code that allows the user to create/generate a QR code. Maily focused on the qrcode library which allows us to create/generate a QR code with particular formatting options (e.g. insertion of a logo with transparency and center placement settings for a more refined/cleaner look as well as foreground/background factors) with the help of the PIL library that will display the data (in this case a YouTube video link) when the QR code is scannned with a compatible scanner/camera.
